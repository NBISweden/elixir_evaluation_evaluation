# Abstract

NBIS teaches, among others, bioinformatics courses, which are
evaluated with an anonymous survey sent its learners.
Part of this survey consists of mandatory questions to assess
course quality.
However, there is discussion in how useful these questions are
in achieving their goal.
Here, we describe the history of this survey, how its questions
were crafted and selected, followed by an evaluation
of its final form.
We find that no selection criterium has been written down
and evidence-based best practices by the academic literature
were ignored.
This paper is the first to transparently show the crafting and
selection of evaluation questions to be used for NBIS evaluation,
being the 'future work' as mentioned in its paper most important to this topic.
