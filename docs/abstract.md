# Abstract

NBIS teaches, among others, bioinformatics courses, which are
evaluated with an anonymous survey sent its learners.
However, there is discussion in how good/useful the survey's
evaluation questions are.
Upon reading the literature on how these questions
were crafted and selected,
one concludes that no selection criterium has been written down.
This paper is the first to transparently show the crafting and
selection of evaluation questions to be used for NBIS evaluation,
being the 'future work' as mentioned in its paper most important to this topic.
