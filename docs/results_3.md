    Dear trainers,

    You are all invited in an experiment to find 'good' course evaluation
    questions, that have the goal to assess course quality, in a way that
    is (1) transparent, (2) as a group, and (3) uses informed decision making.
    This is part of a (draft-stage) paper you can find
    [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/elixir_evaluation_evaluation).

    You are invited to share your favorite evaluation question(s) in this form
    [here](https://forms.gle/5A5JUssebL6NUZTw7).

    If you need more background:

    - You can find the presentation on this on YouTube [here](https://youtu.be/Xo5evD9Jb5g?si=D9UZ3Wrz7ADxOz-A)
    - You can view the presentation slides [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/elixir_evaluation_evaluation/presentations/)

    You are encouraged to share the link to the form with NBIS trainers:
    the goal is to find the set of evaluation questions that we think
    is useful enough to ask to all our course participants.

    Thanks and cheers, Richel
