# Introduction

On 2025-01-20 the NBIS Training Steering Group had
a meeting on course evaluations.
The first question was 'How are evaluations evaluated?'.

It is common practice that courses are evaluated by surveys
`[Brazas & Ouellette, 2016][Gurwitz et al., 2020][Jordan et al., 2023]`.

This does not mean that the questions in such surveys are useful.
For example, 2 out of 3 teachers of one NBIS course have the shared verdict
that the NBIS questions are useless, where 1 is neutral and
reasoning 'it is what we commonly do'.

???- question "Source?"

    You can find one teacher's written-down criticism
    [here](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/misc/evaluation/).
    He openly uses the term 'useless'.

    You can find the meeting notes where it was decided unanymously
    against using the survey in unmodified form
    [here](https://uppmax.github.io/programming_formalisms/meeting_notes/20241010/).
    In this meeting, only orally, the verdict on this survey was:

    - 2x: useless
    - 1x: neutral, as '[such surveys] is what we commonly do'

This disagreement is used as a starting point in evaluating the
NBIS course evaluation questions,
where the literature is searched for how these questions
came to be and by which criteria the best were selected,
in the hope of establishing the usefulness of this survey.

Besides disussing the current survey question,
this paper is the first to give a fully transparent process
on how, with the same goals in mind, a similar set of
evaluation questions were developed
and how the best questions of this set were selected.
