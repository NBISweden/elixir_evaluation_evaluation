# Conclusion

## RQ1

From our literature search,
we conclude that the survey currently used
is not derived from evidence-based best practices.
Neither of the current survey, nor of the surveys it is based on,
has it been published (1) how its questions were developed,
(2) by which criteria the best questions were selected.
