# Conclusion

## RQ1: What is the history of the ELIXIR evaluation questions?

The ELIXIR student evaluation is based on two evaluations.
Neither evaluation describes (1) how its questions were developed,
(2) by which criteria the best questions were
selected.

From these two questionnaires, some (but not all) questions were
selected to be put in the ELIXIR evaluation.
Additionally, ELIXIR added new questions, regarding student
satisfactions.
The criteria for neither not copying questions for the earlier
questionnaires, not for adding adding questions were not written down.

As none of these evaluations describe the process on how questions
were developed, it comes as no surprise that neither
evaluation refers to evidence-based best practices in the literature.

## RQ2: How does the academic literature relate to the ELIXIR evaluation questions?
