# Conclusion

## RQ1

We conclude that the survey currently used
is not derived from evidence-based best practices
and instead is established in more informal ways.
Not of the current survey, nor of the surveys it is based on,
has it been published how the survey questions were developed,
nor by which criteria the best questions were selected.
