# 2025-03-06 Meeting Daniel Wibberg

Goal: find out if and to what extent we collaborate on
the 'ELIXIR evaluation evaluation' paper

- Questions about this draft?
- Join as author?
- Join experiment?

- May I quote you on this, from the Q&A document of last clinic
(at `[URL]`)?
  If yes, how:
    - [x] 'Daniel Wibberg, co-author of [the 2020 paper] and a trainer
      using this evaluation (personal communication)'

```text
Honestly, I haven't found the ELIXIR questions particularly useful
in improving my course.
While they do serve the purpose of collecting numbers for KPIs,
they don't provide the in-depth, qualitative feedback needed
to make substantial course improvements.
The questions focus more on statistical outputs
rather than offering insights into student experiences
or areas for pedagogical enhancement.
As a result, they fall short in helping to identify specific aspects
of the course that could benefit from revision or innovation.
