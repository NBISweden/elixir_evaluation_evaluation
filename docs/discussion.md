## RQ1

Although this is not formally published,
maybe the current survey (or the surveys it is based on)
have been developed by evidence-based best practices,
yet in unpublished and more informal documents.
However, it seems unlikely that references to the literature are
used in informal communication, yet subsequently omitted when
a formal academic paper is written.
To us, it seems more likely that only a shallow research search has been
performed, hence that there was little awareness of the evidence-based
literature at the time of writing.
