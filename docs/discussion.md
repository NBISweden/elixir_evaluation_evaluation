# Discussion

## RQ1

Although this is not formally published,
maybe the current survey (or the surveys it is based on)
have been developed by evidence-based best practices,
yet in unpublished and more informal documents.
However, it seems unlikely that references to the literature are
used in informal communication, yet subsequently omitted when
a formal academic paper is written.
To us, it seems more likely that only a shallow research search has been
performed, hence that there was little awareness of the evidence-based
literature at the time of writing.


## Notes



## Epilogue

We know that teachers reflecting on their work is one of the
best ways to increase his/her teaching quality.
Or: 'student ratings can only become a tool for enhancement when they
feed reflective conversations about improving the learning process and when
these conversations are informed by the scholarship of teaching and
learning `[Roxå et al., 2021]`.
The other best way for teachers to improve is to do peer observations.
Note that neither practice needs an evaluations.

If we really care about teaching quality, shouldn't we encourage
doing the things that actually work?
